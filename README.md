## Technology Stack

- Python 3.11
- Django 4
- PostgreSQL 15

## Installation and running

### Without Docker

- Create virtual environment. Example: `virtualenv venv`
- Enter environment: Example: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.dev.txt`
- Create `.env` file at project root. File .env-example is provided as a guide of this file's content.
- Generate migration files: `python manage.py makemigrations`
- Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input`
- Run using `python manage.py runserver`
- To see the documentation diagrams you require [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).
- To generate dependencies graph
    - All dependencies: `pydeps applications --cluster --keep-target-cluster --rmprefix applications. --reverse`
    - Only circular dependencies: `pydeps applications --show-cycles --reverse`
    - Only
      Core: `pydeps applications --cluster --keep-target-cluster --rmprefix applications. --reverse --only applications.core`

### With Docker

- Create `docker-compose.yml` (you may use docker-compose.example.yml as reference)
- Make sure to have Docker running on your system (in mac, you should have docker icon in top menu).
- Run using: `docker-compose up`

## Testing

### Without Docker

- Run the tests with `python manage.py test`
- Get test coverage with:
    - `coverage run --source='.' manage.py test`
    - `coverage report --skip-covered --show-missing`

### With Docker

- Make sure your service name for the django app is `web` or change it accordingly in the following commands.
- Run the tests with `docker-compose run web python manage.py test`
- Get test coverage with:
    - `docker-compose run web coverage run --source='.' manage.py test`
    - `docker-compose run web coverage report --skip-covered --show-missing`

### Using Swagger for API documentation

- Run project
- Go to `<project URL>/api/<API version>/swagger/`, example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/swagger/` for localhost
- There you can see all endpoints. To use them you have to get the JWT token using the SESSIONS endpoint:
    - Search in Swagger for the `POST /sessions/` endpoint.
    - Use it. You need to provide with a valid `username` and `password` credentials pair.
    - You will receive two tokens: one for `refresh`, the other for `access`. Copy the `access` token in the clipboard.
    - Scroll all up in the Swagger page, find the button called `Authorize`, it has a lock image attached to it. Click
      it.
    - You will see a modal small window with the information of the type of authorization that is going to be used, in
      this case JWT.
    - You will also see a lonely input with the `Value:` label. In this input you have to
      insert `Bearer <access token copied in the clipboard>`.
      Example with fake token: `Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1N` (bear in mind that the real token tends to be
      far longer that this).
    - Click `Authorize` and now all endpoints should start working.
    - Have fun.

## Re-generate translations

- Install GNU gettext tools: https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
- Run the following command to generate django.po file:
  `django-admin makemessages -l es --all --ignore venv --no-location`
- Once all the translations are made, run the command: `django-admin compilemessages`
